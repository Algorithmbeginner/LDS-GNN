Learning Discrete Structures for Graph Neural Networks (TensorFlow implementation)

The accompanying code for 
the ICML 2019 paper [_Learning Discrete Structures for Graph Neural Networks_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11960) will be relesed here soon.

In the meantime, please write to me at luca.franceschi@iit.it if you want to obtain the code via email before it will be released here.
